        enough to notice. Here, the Seven Spirits observe rather than command.<br class="desk" /> They're into patience and going with the flow

            <h3>A Place That Exists Between Moments</h3>
            <p>The Valley of Dreams feels suspended in time. Shrines rest beneath blooming branches. Lantern light reflects on still
            water. Even silence feels intentional.<br>
            This environment isn’t built to impress — it’s built to calm. The more attention you give it, the more it reveals.</p>
